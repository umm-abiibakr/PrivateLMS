        <p>
            Founded in <strong>1446 AH / 2025 CE</strong> in Abuja, Nigeria, <em>Warathatul Ambiya</em>, meaning
            <strong>“Inheritors of the Prophets”</strong>, is a private library dedicated to preserving authentic
            Islamic literature. Our collection is meticulously curated, featuring books endorsed by esteemed
            <strong>Salafi scholars</strong>, ensuring strict adherence to the <strong>Qur’an</strong>,
            <strong>Sunnah</strong>, and the methodology of the <em>Salaf-us-Sālih</em> (righteous predecessors).
        </p>
        <p>
            Primarily offering reliable English translations—with select works in Arabic and a few in Hausa—
            our library addresses the scarcity of trustworthy translated texts. We aim to serve sincere seekers
            of knowledge by providing access to these rare resources, <em>bi idhnillāh</em>, fostering a deeper
            engagement with Islamic scholarship.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-4">Our Mission</h5>
        <p>
            The limited availability of authentic Islamic texts—especially reliable translations—poses a challenge

            trusted collection to the Abuja community. A recommendation system enriches the user experience,
            helping members discover relevant texts based on their interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a private institution, we are committed to preserving our collection for future generations,
            <em>bi idhnillāh</em>.
        </p>
